# Draw and Shake
A Mobile App Project By Liam Morton, Nathan L'Abbe and Jacob Dimoff

GitHub, Jira, and Time tracker will be managed by Jacob Dimoff

The goal off Draw and Shake, is to display our skills as mobile app developers by creating an app that mimics the classic child's toy, the Etch-a-sketch. The appwould feature a main page to get started, the ablity to grab old files you worked on, and two modes to draw it. Classic mode, where th euser must nevvagte a constant;y drawing cursour on the screen using a simulated joystick, and a pencial mode in which the user simply draws by moving there figure across the screen. Once the user has finshed, they can either save the drawing or shake the screen and watch there drawing disapper.
