# Draw Research
By Jacob Dimoff

The goal of these notes is to find relevant kotlin libraries that contain relevant info on how to let a suer draw contents to the screen.
<!-- This source code will later be translated into a pdf for easier readability for users if needed. -->

The first set of this is to search whether Kotlin has anything to help draw to the screen, my search was "draw to the screen kotlin".

The first result was to the andorid developers website with title "Custom Drawings" https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/custom-views/custom-drawing
