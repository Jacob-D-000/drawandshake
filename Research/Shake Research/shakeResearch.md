# Shake Research
By Jacob Dimoff

The goal of these notes is to find relevant Kotlin libraries that contain relevant info on how to let the user use shakes the phone as input.
<!-- This source code will later be translated into a PDF for easier readability for users if needed. -->

Some things that I would like to find include:
- Event listener
- Determining shake intensity
- How to remove things from the screen after a shake.
